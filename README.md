# GooseDitor

A simple text editor for the web, written using HTML, [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [jquery-textrange](https://github.com/dwieeb/jquery-textrange). While it supports basic auto-completion and auto-indentation, adding syntax highlighting will probably prove to be a more arduous task as the HTML textarea element does not seem to support multiple text colors.
